      <div class="story-content">
        <p class="story-intro">
          Every great innovation begins with a simple idea and a passionate team. StartCodingNow was born in the collaborative classrooms of Concordia University, where a group of diverse computer science students shared a common vision: to make coding education more accessible, engaging, and effective for beginners.
        </p>
        
        <div class="story-details">
          <h3 class="subtitle">The Spark of Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            During our IT course in 2022, we noticed how many beginners struggled with traditional coding resources. The materials were either too technical or oversimplified, leaving many aspiring coders frustrated. We asked ourselves: <em>"What if we could create a learning platform that grows with the student?"</em> That question became our mission.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="subtitle">From Concept to Reality</h3>
          <p>
            What started as a semester project quickly evolved into something bigger. Late nights in the university library turned into coding marathons, with each team member bringing unique perspectives from our varied backgrounds in web development, education, and design. We prototyped, tested, and refined our approach based on feedback from fellow students.
          </p>
          
          <h3 class="subtitle">Our Guiding Principles</h3>
          <ul class="principles-list">
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Breaking down complex concepts into digestible lessons</li>
            <li><strong>Community:</strong> Creating spaces for learners to connect and grow together</li>
            <li><strong>Practicality:</strong> Focusing on real-world applications from day one</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Continuously improving our methods based on user feedback</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="story-closing">
            Today, StartCodingNow has grown beyond our classroom walls, but we remain committed to that original vision. We're proud to have helped thousands take their first steps into programming, and we're just getting started. Join us as we continue to make coding education more inclusive and effective for everyone.
